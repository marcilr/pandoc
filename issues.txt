Issues with pandoc latex conversion to doc or docx


From conversion of git/tex/template/template.tex to docx 
using:

$ pandoc template.tex -o template.docx
Observe the following issues in the resultant docx:

o All the headings are grey not black
o Lost abstract on 1st page
o Lost diagonal DRAFT notice on 1st page
o Lost DRAFT notice on bottom of all subsequent pages
o Lost Contents on 2nd page
o Lost page numbers
o List of Definitions and Abbreviations from 4th page to 1st page
o Introduction from th page to 1st page

Benefits:
o Kept footnotes
o Verbatim looks great
o Kept Appendix


$ pandoc template.tex -o template.doc
Appears to have less issues:
o Keeps headers black
o Looses page numbers
o Looses individual pages
